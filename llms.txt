## Documentation Files

### API v1 Documentation (Auto-generated canonical)
- Raw markdown: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yaniv-golan/affinity-api-docs/main/docs/v1/affinity_api_docs.md
- Contents: full Affinity API v1 reference (auth, endpoints, schemas, rate limits, examples in bash/Ruby/Python/Node, JSON requests/responses, changelog). Generated via `tools/v1_sync_pipeline/sync_v1_docs.py`.

### API v2 Documentation
- Coming soon (folder scaffolded at `docs/v2/`).

## LLM Guardrails

1. **Do NOT edit** `docs/v1/affinity_api_docs.md` manually. Regenerate it by running:
   ```
   python tools/v1_sync_pipeline/sync_v1_docs.py
   ```
2. Before proposing edits, run the QA helpers:
   - `python tools/v1_sync_pipeline/qa/check_links.py docs/v1/affinity_api_docs.md`
   - `pytest tests/`
3. If you detect anchor overrides becoming stale, update `BROKEN_ANCHOR_MAP` in `sync_v1_docs.py` and document the review in the quarterly issue.
4. CI already runs the sync + link checker daily and opens PRs automatically. LLMs should focus on improving the tooling, **not** the generated markdown content.

## Usage Guidance

- LLMs and IDE copilots should load the canonical raw markdown above for grounding and RAG use cases.
- Documentation is optimized for structured parsing (fenced code blocks with explicit languages).
- If automation pipelines change, update this file to keep the guardrails in sync.
