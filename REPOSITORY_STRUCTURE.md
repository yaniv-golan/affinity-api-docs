# Repository Structure Best Practices

This document explains the repository structure and why files are organized this way.

## Directory Structure

### `.github/` - GitHub-Specific Configuration

- **Purpose**: Contains GitHub Actions + CI-only helpers
- **Contents**:
  - `workflows/` - Actions definitions (`check-docs-updates.yml`, `tests.yml`, `pre-commit.yml`)
  - `scripts/validate_docs_structure.py` - Lightweight CI validation helper
  - `docs-version-*.json` - Metadata files used by historic workflows
  - **CI note**: `check-docs-updates.yml` auto-creates the `chore/sync-affinity-docs` branch/PR and then explicitly triggers `tests.yml` and `pre-commit.yml` via `workflow_dispatch` so that required checks run even though the PR is opened by a workflow.

**Why here?**: Keeps automation-specific assets scoped to GitHub configuration.

### `tests/` - Test Files

- **Purpose**: Contains all test scripts and test-related files
- **Contents**:
  - Test scripts (`.sh`, `.py`)
  - Test documentation (`README.md`)

**Why here?**: Standard practice - test files belong in a `tests/` directory at the repository root, not in `.github/`.

### `docs/development/` - Development Documentation

- **Purpose**: Documentation for developers working on the project
- **Contents**:
  - `TESTING.md` - Testing guide
  - `TEST_RESULTS.md` - Test results summary

**Why here?**: Development documentation belongs in `docs/`, separate from user-facing documentation.

### `tools/v1_sync_pipeline/` - Production Sync + QA Tooling

- **Purpose**: Houses the production-ready sync pipeline and QA scripts
- **Contents**:
  - `sync_v1_docs.py` – Fetches live HTML, renders markdown, writes metadata
  - `qa/check_links.py` – Anchor/external link validation
  - `qa/compare_to_live.py` – Manual comparison helper for browser snapshots

**Why here?**: Separates long-lived automation from discarded extraction experiments (`scripts/` directory has been removed).

### `requirements-ci.txt` - CI Dependencies

- **Purpose**: Python dependencies needed for CI/CD workflows
- **Location**: Repository root

**Why here?**: Standard practice—requirements files sit at the root and make it easy for workflows to install dependencies.

### `tmp/` - Generated Artifacts (Gitignored)

- **Purpose**: Holds HTML snapshots, extracted code blocks, and comparison reports generated by the sync pipeline
- **Behavior**: Listed in `.gitignore`; contents are safe to delete/regenerate

**Why here?**: Keeps transient data out of version control while giving engineers a predictable place to inspect intermediate outputs.

## Best Practices Followed

1. ✅ **Tests in `tests/`** - Not in `.github/`
2. ✅ **Documentation in `docs/`** - Organized by purpose
3. ✅ **Requirements at root** - Standard location
4. ✅ **GitHub configs in `.github/`** - GitHub-specific files
5. ✅ **Clear separation** - Each directory has a clear purpose

## File Locations Summary

| File Type | Location | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Test scripts | `tests/` | Standard practice |
| Test docs | `docs/development/` | Development docs |
| CI scripts | `.github/scripts/` | GitHub-specific (only `validate_docs_structure.py` remains) |
| Sync pipeline | `tools/v1_sync_pipeline/` | Production automation + QA helpers |
| Workflows | `.github/workflows/` | GitHub Actions |
| Requirements | `requirements-ci.txt` | Root level, CI-specific |
| Metadata | `.github/docs-version-*.json` | Workflow state |
